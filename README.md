# Budget Tracker Project 💰

### Submitted by: [Your Name] | [Your Roll Number]

## 📖 Project Overview
This is a Python-based command-line application developed as part of a Python programming course. It helps users track and manage their daily expenses by allowing them to add, categorize, and summarize spending. The project demonstrates modular programming, file handling, and basic data visualization using Python libraries.

## ✨ Features
* **Expense Management:** Add expenses with date, category, amount, and description.
* **Data Persistence:** Stores expenses in a CSV file for permanent record-keeping.
* **Summary Reports:** Displays total expenses grouped by category.
* **Visualizations:** Generates bar charts showing expense distribution by category.
* **User-Friendly CLI:** Simple menu-driven interface for easy navigation.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project is organized to ensure maintainability and clarity:
* `budget_tracker.py`: Main script with application logic and user interface.
* `expenses.csv`: CSV file storing expense records (created on first run).
* `statement.md`: Contains problem statement, scope, target users, and features.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Language:** Python 3  
* **Libraries:** pandas (data handling), matplotlib (visualization)

## 🚀 Steps to Install & Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/budget-tracker.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    python budget_tracker.py
    ```
5. Follow on-screen prompts to add expenses and view summaries.

## ✔️ Instructions for Testing
Test the application by:
1. Adding expenses with valid and invalid inputs to verify validation.
2. Viewing summarized expense reports and charts for correctness.
3. Restarting the application to confirm data persistence.
4. Optionally, writing unit tests for core functions using Python’s `unittest` or `pytest`.
